# Periodic Noise Reduction in Image Processing

Periodic noise can significantly impact image quality, making it challenging to extract meaningful information. This repository provides methods for detecting and mitigating periodic noise in images, which is crucial in various applications, including medical imaging, surveillance, and remote sensing.

## Overview

Periodic noise can obscure important features and hinder accurate analysis in images. This project addresses this issue using three primary approaches:

1. **Frequency Domain Filtering:** Transform the image into the frequency domain using techniques such as Fourier Transform or Wavelet Transform. Apply filters to the frequency components to remove or reduce noise effects. This method effectively isolates and eliminates noise with distinct frequency patterns.

2. **Spatial Domain Filtering:** Operate directly on the pixels of the image. Apply filters such as Median Filter, Mean Filter, and Anisotropic Diffusion Filter to remove or reduce noise. This method involves convolution operations with a filter kernel to process pixel neighborhoods.

3. **Machine Learning Techniques:** Utilize deep learning models to recognize and remove periodic noise patterns from images. Train neural networks to distinguish noise from useful information and enhance image quality.

## Methods

### Frequency Domain Filtering

- **Fourier Transform:** Converts the image into a frequency representation using sine and cosine functions.
- **Wavelet Transform:** Converts the image into a frequency representation using localized wavelets.
- **Filtering:** Apply low-pass or high-pass filters to remove specific frequency components of noise.

### Spatial Domain Filtering

- **Median Filter:** Replaces each pixel's value with the median of pixel values in its neighborhood.
- **Mean Filter:** Replaces each pixel's value with the average of pixel values in its neighborhood.
- **Anisotropic Diffusion:** Applies a filter that smooths the image while preserving edges.

### Machine Learning Techniques

- **Neural Networks:** Train models to identify and remove noise patterns using supervised learning approaches.
